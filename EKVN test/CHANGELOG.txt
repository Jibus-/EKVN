version 1.1.7 Feb-11-2015
. [NEW] Added a "Typewriter Text" mode (activated/deactivated in script using the .SETTYPEWRITERTEXT command). When active, this causes text to appear one character at a time, instead of the previous way where the text faded into view. (Warning: this is a semi-experimental quick-and-dirty hack! It'll probably work without incident… probably.)

version 1.1.6 Feb-03-2015
. [NEW] Added a "cinematic text" mode (activated/deactivated in script using the .SETCINEMATICTEXT command). This causes the text/dialogue to advance without user input after a certain period of time.

version 1.1.5 Nov-01-2014
. [NEW] Added “no skipping until text is shown” Boolean flag to “vnscene view settings.plist” (and VNScene), which prevents skipping dialogue until the text has completely appeared on screen (default value for flag is “NO”)

version 1.1.4 May-12-2014
